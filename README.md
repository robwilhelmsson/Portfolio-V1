# Portfolio Showcase

I'm thrilled to present my portfolio website, featuring a collection of projects completed during my experience at General Assembly, where I successfully completed the Software Engineering Bootcamp.

## Design Inspiration

While drawing inspiration from some of the best portfolios on the web, I aimed to infuse my own creativity into the design to make it uniquely mine.

## Technologies Used

The portfolio was crafted using:

- **React and Gatsby**: for a performant and dynamic user experience.
- **Styled Components**: to style components with the added advantage of using global variables.
- **Mobile and Web Friendly**: Ensuring accessibility across devices.

## Challenges Faced

Throughout the development journey, I encountered a few challenges:

- **Mobile Responsiveness**: The projects section presented difficulties in achieving optimal mobile responsiveness. While it functions well, further enhancements for mobile display are on my agenda. This is apparent mostly in the Projects section where the styling of the components works a lot better on web. 
  
- **Data Storage**: I opted to use files for project data content due to the limited information I had to put across. In the future, migrating to a database is something I would look into. 

## Styling

In my pursuit of aesthetic appeal, I implemented some styling features:

- **Mouse Glow**: A subtle glow effect was added for a captivating visual experience.
  
- **Hover Animations**: Components come to life with engaging animations upon hover. I'm open to refining these with more practice.
